# Hydrological Tool (Flask + Open-Meteo)

This repo contains a small Flask application that serves the frontend and performs Open-Meteo API calls and hydrological data processing on the backend.

Files added/changed:
- `app.py` — Flask application and `/api/analyze` endpoint. The server fetches Open-Meteo data year-by-year, processes it, and returns JSON results.
- `templates/index.html` — the frontend adapted to call the backend API instead of calling Open-Meteo directly.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.

Quick start (bash on Windows):

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

4. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.

Notes:
- The frontend uses Chart.js and FileSaver via CDN.
- Data fetching and hydrological calculations are done in `app.py` (endpoint `/api/analyze`).
- CSV export remains client-side using the processed data returned from the server.
